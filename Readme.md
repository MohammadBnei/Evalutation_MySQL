# This is a MySQL evaluation repo for My Digital School, Paris

## Start

You have to setup your database (MySQL), and put the connection's options in the **config/config.js** file.
**eval_mysql_db_creationScript.sql** is a creation script for the database.
In the **export** folder, you will find data to populate de database.

*user email* : **test@dummy.com**
*admin email* : **admin@eval.com**
*password* : **test**

Once this is all done, type npm start in the terminal to start **both** the server and the client.
A new page will open in your browser.
